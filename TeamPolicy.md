# Conflict Plan

**Our SOP**

## Group Process to Resolve Conflict

- We are all open to feedback/constructive criticism 
- If an argument arises, go to another digital space to discuss with the individual. If one-on-one conversation doesn't solve the issue, involve another group member as a mediator
- Before voting on an idea, make sure all have spoken their opinions

## Talking to Team Members who Aren't Actively Contributing

- Offer to pair-program with them
- Have structure to meetings and check-ins to make sure all have time to contribute


## General Notes

- Speak up and communicate! Especially if you feel you are struggling
- Be direct with Carlos!!! And with everyone. 
- If attempts to de-escalate don't work, then **escalate**
- Keian may be sarcastic
- No gossip. 
- Take any big issues to Sara, that can not be resolved within the group

# Communication Plan

- Use Slack to communicate 
  - Send slack message when working on a new feature to alert other group members
- Use group Zoom link for check-ins [Zoom Link](https://us05web.zoom.us/j/4273494316?pwd=eGJYaC9qcUViWEREQmxhNjl2dTdaQT09) Password: 1234
- Use Trello to communicate which features are completed and in-progress

If we notice that someone isn't speaking in a conversation, be aware and engage them. 

## Creating a Safe Environment 

- Keep the environment friendly
- Listen fully to other's ideas 
- Follow the guidelines of Psych Safety :)

# Work Plan

Morning check-in @ 9AM in Remo
- Define objectives on Trello
  - First check-in focused on getting synced with what the site will look like & do

Mid-day check-in 
- Play it by ear, this depends on who is working on what features, etc.

Night check-in @ 8PM
- Sync up all our local repos with the stage branch (or main branch, if there are new features)

# Git Process

Main branch only changed when new, complete features are added
Stage branch changed when individual has new branch to add

- One group repo, an org with all group members added
  - Individuals make branches = name
  - After branch is merged, pull down *stage branch* to local computer
- To push stage to main, all group members must review and approve
- To push individual branch to stage, one other group member must review and approve
- Last reviewer merges the Pull Request
- Communicate in slack channel if you need a pull request reviewed
